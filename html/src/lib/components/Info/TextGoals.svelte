<h2><strong>Goal/</strong></h2>


The goal of this CodeJam is to challenge ourselves to build something engaging to share with others, ideally with others, and… to make it as fun as possible. 😀 It’s an opportunity to exercise skills in collaboration, creativity, and learning. How does it feel to work in a team? I don’t know - let’s find out!

Can we learn from each other? Can we improve each other’s resourcefulness? If one person improves as a developer, or if a new friendship is made, we would be so happy and consider this event a success. As a bonus, maybe we can add a new project to our resume and gain a new network that lasts beyond this event. :)

Category: Twitch-Integration

Yeeeep. Since this community was created on Twitch, we thought it'd be appropriate if the CodeJam revolved around Twitch related software! Don't get started yet, you still need the THEME, but we wanted to let you know what you're signing up for.

The options are really endless when it comes to Twitch integration. Examples:

    Chat bots
    Twitch Extensions
    Game overlays
    Website
    So on and so forth, as long as we can tell it's something that has to do with Twitch. :)
